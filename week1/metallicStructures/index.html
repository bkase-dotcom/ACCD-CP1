  <h1>Metallic Crystal Structures — Text-Based Visualizations</h1>
  <p>
    This webpage displays 3D ASCII art illustrations of common metallic crystal structures:
    Simple Cubic (SC), Body-Centered Cubic (BCC), and Face-Centered Cubic (FCC).
    All visualizations are made using only HTML and formatted text, mimicking traditional ball-and-stick models in a minimalist style.
  </p>

  <h2>Simple Cubic (SC)</h2>
  <pre>
       o-----------o
      /           /|
     /           / |
    o-----------o  |

    o-----------o
  </pre>
  <p>
    The simple cubic structure consists of atoms at each of the 8 corners of the cube.
    Each corner atom is shared among 8 neighboring unit cells. This structure is rare in metals due to its low packing efficiency.
  </p>

  <h2>Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)</h2>
  <pre>
       o-----------o
      /           /|
     /     o     / |
    o-----------o  |
    |           |  |
    |           | o |
    |     o     |  o
    |           | /
    |           |/
    o-----------o
  </pre>
  <p>
    The BCC structure has 8 corner atoms and 1 atom at the center of the cube.
    It has a coordination number of 8 and a packing efficiency of about 68%. Common in iron, chromium, and tungsten.
  </p>

  <h2>Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)</h2>
  <pre>
       o------o
      /|     /|
     o·o----o·|
     |·|    |o|
     |o·----o·o
     |/     |/
     o------o
  </pre>
  <p>
    The FCC structure contains atoms at each corner and in the center of each face.
    This gives it a coordination number of 12 and the highest packing efficiency (~74%) among cubic lattices. Found in aluminum, copper, and gold.
