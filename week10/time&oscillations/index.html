        <h2>Project Context & Goals</h2>
        <p>
          This project began as an exploration of time-based animation and oscillatory motion
          using p5.js. The assignment required the use of trigonometric functions, time-driven
          intervals, desynchronized motion, and organic variation through randomness or noise.
          Rather than treating these requirements as isolated techniques, I approached the
          sketch as a system—using a solar eclipse as a visual metaphor for layered motion,
          depth, and signal-driven behavior.
          <br><br>
          The goal was to create a scene where multiple parameters—position, scale, brightness,
          and draw order—were all linked through shared time and signal inputs, resulting in a
          continuously evolving animation rather than a simple loop.
        </p>

        <h2>Concept & Visual Direction</h2>
        <p>
          The core concept was a lateral view of a moon orbiting a sun, passing alternately in
          front of and behind it. This perspective allowed depth to be communicated through
          size changes, brightness shifts, and occlusion, rather than explicit 3D rendering.
          A minimal black space background was chosen to keep focus on motion, rhythm, and
          layered behavior rather than environmental detail.
        </p>

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <h3>Textured Sun Foundation</h3>
        <p>
          The project began with the construction of a static sun rendered as a circle filled
          using Perlin noise. Instead of applying noise directly as a texture, the surface was
          sampled on a grid and drawn using many small points, with noise values mapped to subtle
          color variation. Introducing a third noise dimension tied to time created a slow,
          boiling motion that established the organic visual language of the sketch.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h3>Early Orbital Motion Experiments</h3>
        <p>
          Initial attempts at moon motion relied on sinusoidal offsets applied directly to
          position. While this satisfied the requirement for trigonometric movement, the
          resulting path appeared artificial and lacked a clear spatial relationship to
          the sun. This iteration highlighted the need for a more physically legible orbital
          structure.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h3>Elliptical Orbit & Depth Encoding</h3>
        <p>
          The moon’s motion was redefined using an ellipse parameterized by sine and cosine.
          A single trigonometric value was treated as a proxy for depth, allowing the sketch
          to infer whether the moon was closer or farther from the viewer. This depth value
          became the driver for multiple visual parameters, including scale, brightness,
          and draw order.

        </figure>

        <h3>Front and Back Eclipse Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          To reinforce the illusion of depth, the moon was rendered darker when passing in
          front of the sun and brighter when behind it, mimicking the way light would behave
          in a real eclipse scenario. Explicit control over draw order ensured that the moon
          could properly occlude the sun during the front pass and disappear behind it during
          the back pass.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h3>Environmental Context: Starfield</h3>
        <p>
          A procedural starfield was added to provide spatial context. Stars were randomly
          distributed once and assigned fixed noise coordinates. Over time, noise-driven
          brightness variation produced a subtle twinkling effect without abrupt flicker,
          reinforcing the project’s emphasis on smooth temporal change.
        </p>

        <h2>System Integration & Audio Response</h2>
        <p>
          In the final phase, the sketch was extended into a more complete system. Audio
          input was integrated using p5.sound and FFT analysis, enabling a three-layer
          solar aura that responds dynamically to sound. Log-scaled frequency mapping
          ensured that multiple frequency bands contributed meaningfully to the visual
          output.
          <br><br>
          The project was migrated into VS Code and embedded within a structured HTML layout.
          UI controls were added for audio upload, playback, and microphone input, and the
          canvas was placed inside a responsive container with careful padding to prevent
          visual clipping. CSS styling unified the controls and visualization into a single,
          cohesive interactive tile.
