      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        My previous 3D experience has mostly been in Autodesk Fusion, using parametric,
        engineering-oriented modeling. Most recently I used Fusion to develop hardware
        for a portable weighted piano keyboard. Blender, by contrast, is built around
        polygon mesh modeling and is better suited for artistic work. Starting this
        project required me to shift away from a parametric mindset and get comfortable
        with Blender’s less rigid but more expressive mesh workflow. After the initial
        learning curve, I came to appreciate the extra freedom Blender provides.

      <h2>Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        For the subject of the project I looked at plants in my living space. I began
        by trying to model a money tree, but eventually pivoted to a fiddle leaf fig.
        The fiddle leaf has a simpler main stem and larger leaves, which made it more
        manageable for a low-poly study. I kept the original pot from the money tree
        attempt since it was easier to model and I preferred its texture. Working from
        a single reference photo is limiting for high-fidelity modeling, but it works
        well for low-poly forms.
      </p>

      <h2>Process</h2>

      <h3>Pot Modeling</h3>
      <p>
        The project began with the pot, modeled from a cylinder mesh. I scaled the base
        inward to create a tapered shape, added an inset at the top opening, extruded
        downward to form the inner wall, and then extruded the inner face outward to
        create space for the soil.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <h3>First Stem Attempt</h3>
      <p>
        My first approach to the stems used cylinder meshes. I extruded, scaled, rotated,
        and duplicated cylindrical segments to create a cluster of trunks similar to the
        money tree reference.
      </p>

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>
        However, the cylindrical topology made branching difficult. I realized it would be
        hard to get clean, organic branch junctions with this approach, so I decided to
        rethink both the plant choice and the modeling strategy.
      </p>

      <h3>Bézier Curve Stem</h3>
      <p>
        I switched to the fiddle leaf fig reference and rebuilt the main stem using a
        Bézier curve. At first the curve is only a path in 3D space with no volume.
        Using the curve’s bevel controls, I added thickness to turn it into a pipe-like
        stalk, then adjusted individual control points and radii in Edit Mode to create
        more organic, tapered variation along the stem and branches.

      <h3>Leaf Modeling</h3>
      <p>
        Leaves were modeled from a simple square plane. I extruded edges outward to rough
        in the silhouette, subdivided faces, and used proportional editing to push
        vertices until the overall shape and curvature matched the fiddle leaf fig
        reference. Additional tweaks added slight bends and asymmetry to keep the leaf
        from feeling too mechanical.

      </div>

      <h3>Procedural Shading & Materials</h3>
      <p>
        I used procedural shading to build an organic leaf material, adding subtle
        variation in color and roughness plus simplified vein details. The finished
        leaf was duplicated, translated, and rotated along the branches until each stem
        felt balanced and believable.

      </figure>
      <p>
        For the pot and soil I used Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials downloaded
        from Poly Haven. These were appended into the project’s Blender file and applied
        to the respective meshes, giving the pot a worn stone look and the soil a more
        detailed surface.

    <section id="rendering">
      <h2>Rendering</h2>
      <p>
        For final presentation I rendered the plant inside a studio-style bedroom HDRI
        environment using the Cycles render engine. The first render looked off because
        the plant floated without a visible shadow. To solve this, I placed a simple mesh
        plane beneath the pot and set it as a <em>Shadow Catcher</em> in the object
        visibility settings. This allowed the HDRI to remain as the visible background
        while the plane only contributed realistic contact shadows.
