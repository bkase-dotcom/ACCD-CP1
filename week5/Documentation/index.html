      <h2>Modeling & Asset Preparation</h2>
      <p>
        The piano prototype was initially designed and modeled in Fusion 360, where I focused on establishing the overall proportions, key geometry, and housing form using a parametric workflow. Fusion allowed me to quickly iterate on dimensions, edge fillets, and component relationships while keeping the design grounded in real-world scale and manufacturability. 
        Once the core components were finalized, the model was exported from Fusion 360 and imported into Blender for visualization, material work, and scene building. After import, the geometry was cleaned and organized into logical objects and collections to make it easier to work with during lighting, animation, and rendering. 
        To create the full-length keyboard, I duplicated and repeated the key modules directly in Blender, aligning them precisely to extend the instrument while maintaining consistent spacing and proportions. This approach allowed me to efficiently scale the design without reworking the original Fusion model, while also taking advantage of Blender’s non-destructive transformation tools. 
        By combining Fusion 360 for precise parametric modeling and Blender for layout, duplication, and visualization, I was able to move quickly from a functional design model into a presentation-ready prototype suitable for documentation and cinematic rendering.

      <h2>Concept & Shot Plan</h2>
      <p>
        My initial concept was to place the piano in a hotel room environment, using a
        desk or table to suggest portability and real-world travel use. As the project
        evolved, I pivoted away from this contextual setting toward a more abstract,
        expansive black studio space. This change allowed the piano to be presented with
        the visual language of a professional product launch, where form, proportion,
        and material take precedence over narrative context.

      <h2>Process</h2>

      <h3>Base Scene Setup</h3>
      <p>
        The project began by isolating the piano model in a minimal Blender scene. The
        world background was set to near-black to eliminate distractions and establish
        a controlled studio environment. This approach kept the scene lightweight and
        allowed for rapid iteration.

      </figure>

      <h3>Geometry & Proportion Refinement</h3>
      <p>
        I adjusted the piano’s overall length and proportions to ensure it read clearly
        from low, elongated camera angles. Emphasizing the linear form of the keyboard
        was important for communicating scale and portability.

      <h3>Interface Elements</h3>
      <p>
        Simple cylindrical geometry was added to represent physical controls such as
        knobs and buttons. At this stage, the focus was on silhouette and placement
        rather than detailed interaction design.

      <h3>Table Asset Integration</h3>
      <p>
        A table asset downloaded from Poly Haven was appended into the scene to ground
        the piano and provide a sense of scale. The table was intentionally kept neutral
        so it would support the piano without drawing attention away from it.

      <h3>Planned Camera Movement (Bezier Path)</h3>
      <p>
        Although the final submission focuses on still imagery, the scene was designed
        with a cinematic intro animation in mind. A Bézier curve was created to act as
        a camera path, starting close to the piano’s internal/control region, dollying
        outward to reveal the body, sweeping along the keys, and resolving in an overhead
        aerial shot. This planned motion influenced framing and layout decisions even
        when camera constraints were temporarily disabled for still renders.

      <h2>Lighting & Rendering</h2>
      <p>
        The lighting setup followed a traditional studio photography approach using
        area lights: a primary key light to define form, a soft fill light to manage
        shadows, and a rim light to separate the piano from the dark background. While
        early look development was done in EEVEE for speed, the final hero image was
        rendered using the Cycles render engine for improved realism, softer shadows,
        and more accurate material response.
